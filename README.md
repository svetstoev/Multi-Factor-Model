# Multi-Factor-Model
Research and implementation of alpha factors as well as a risk factor model construction. Using alpha and risk factors for portfolio optimisation

**1. Project scope**

In this project, I am building a statistical risk model using PCA. Using this model, I am constructing a portfolio along with 5 alpha factors. I am creating these factors, then evaluating them using factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, sharpe ratio, and turnover analysis. At the end of the project, I am optimising the portfolio using the risk model and factors as well as multiple optimisation formulations.

**2. Datasets used**

The end of day data from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar have been used for this project.

**3. Initial requirements**

In order to make use of the project, the user should have a Python- version 3.5.2 installed on their PC, so that they can compile and run the codes included in the current repository.

**4. Repository constituents**

- `mfm.ipynb` - This Jupyter Notebook contains all of the functions needed to complete the project as well as explanatory comments which are aimed at guiding the user along the way
- `README.md` - the file that you are currently reading

**5. Authors**

Svetlozar Stoev as a part of a project assignment from the Udacity 'AI for Trading' Nanodegree Program
