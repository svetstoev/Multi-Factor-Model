# Multi-Factor-Model
Research and implementation of alpha factors as well as a risk factor model construction. Using alpha and risk factors to optimise a portfolio


**1. Project scope**

The purpose of this project is to build a statistical risk model using PCA. Using this model, we are constructing a portfolio along with 5 alpha factors. We are creating these factors, then evaluating them using factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, sharpe ratio, and turnover analysis. At the end of the project, the portfolio is optimised using the risk model and factors as well as multiple optimisation formulations.

**2. Datasets used**

The end of day data from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar have been used for this project.

**3. Initial requirements**

In order to make use of the project, the user should have a Python- version 3.5.2 installed on their PC, so that they can compile and run the codes included in the current repository.

**4. Repository constituents**

- `mfm.ipynb` - This Jupyter Notebook contains all of the functions needed to complete the project as well as explanatory comments which are aimed at guiding the user along the way
- `README.md` - the file that you are currently reading
